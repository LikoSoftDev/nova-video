Uploading and Displaying Videos in Laravel Nova

This package is an extended version of the built-in Nova file field, designed to simplify the process of uploading local video files and displaying them within the Nova panel.

You don't require any additional packages to utilize the `NovaVideo` field. However, if you desire more advanced features, we recommend complementing it with `Larupload`.
