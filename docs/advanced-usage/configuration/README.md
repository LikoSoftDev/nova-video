# Configuration

Video field comes with a flexible configuration system that allows you to customize its behavior according to your specific needs.&#x20;

To publish the configuration file, you can run the following artisan command:&#x20;

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mostafaznv\NovaVideo\VideoFieldServiceProvider"
```

This will publish the configuration file to the <mark style="color:red;">`config/nova-video.php`</mark>, and it contains various options that you can adjust to tailor the package to your requirements.&#x20;
