Beginning with <mark style="color:red;">v6.2</mark>, the Video field now supports URLs in addition to files. If you need to display videos from plain URLs, the URL mode is tailored for your requirements. It replaces the file uploader with a text field for ease of input.

#### **Accepted Values:**

* **UPLOADED**: Allows users to upload video files directly.
* **URL**: Enables users to input plain urls for video content.
